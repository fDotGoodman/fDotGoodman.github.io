							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p><b>Abstract:</b> This paper looks into different machine learning approaches to determine the best starting point for detecting forest fires in near real-time. A Decision Tree, a Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and a Gradient Boosted Tree are analysed on the Fires from Space: Australia dataset. The requirement for accurate forest fire detection is explored, considering he economic and safety factors. The literature review looks at pre-existing approaches to forest fire detection, both in the methods we are evaluating and further approaches. Methodology and Experimental Setup detail and justify the approach to determine the best classifier. The validity of the results is ensured with various baseline comparisons and statistical tests, allowing for a meaningful conclusion. The observations show that the Gradient Boosted Tree performs the best. Through this IEEE-compliant paper, we conclude that this method is the most suitable starting point for optimisation.</p>
