							<p>This project accompanies the paper titled <i>Evaluating the Effectiveness of Different Machine Learning Classifiers at Detecting Forest Fires in a Near Real-Time Environment</i> It involved implementing a number of Machine Learning classifiers to classify forest fires. The model was trained on archival satellite instrument data, and tested on a labelled near-real-time dataset from the same satellites. The aim of the project was to evaluate the baseline effectiveness of classifiers implemented through Apache Spark to ascertain the best starting point for forest fire prediction. Furthermore, a scalability comparison was made to compare the performance on a locally hosted Spark cluster, with one hosted on Azure Databricks.</p>
							<p>The classifiers implemented were: a Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, a Gradient Boosted Tree, and a Decision Tree. The Gradient Boosted Tree was found to outperform those other classifiers in this problem domain, and scale better through Databricks.</p>

Whilst I therefore cannot publicly display this, please let me know if you would like to see it, and I'll make you a contributor on the GitHub repository.
