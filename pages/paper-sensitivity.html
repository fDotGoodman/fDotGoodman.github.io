							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p><b>Abstract:</b> An artificial immune system is an algorithmic model that encapsulates the biological principles and processes within the natural mammalian immune system.  This work proposes a novel artificial immune system as an agent-based simulation, implemented through Repast Simphony. It evaluates the sensitivity of the model to its initial parameters, encapsulating network intrusion data as pathogens in the system. This work introduces a Support Vector Machine as a means of classifying intrusive network transmissions, using posterior classification probability as a means of modelling pathogen danger, finally interfacing the transmission's information and danger with the simulation. This dissertation finds that the created model is sensitive to all tested parameters in that they meaningfully impact the results of running the simulation. It also finds the Support Vector Machine as a suitable candidate for classifying network intrusions.</p>
